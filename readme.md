- 🔴 Poor TypeScript implementation or complete lack of type safety
- 🔴 Missing or inadequate test coverage
- 🔴 Incomplete MCP protocol implementation
- 🔴 Security vulnerabilities
- 🔴 Unreliable error handling
- 🔴 Lack of proper documentation

This motivated us to create Claudeus WordPress MCP - not just as another WordPress management tool, but as a reference implementation that demonstrates:

- ✅ Complete TypeScript coverage with strict type checking
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (95%+ coverage)
- ✅ Full MCP 2024-11-05 specification compliance
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security practices

### 🤘 Why We Made It Free

Claudeus WordPress MCP was born from our passion for both heavy metal and heavy-duty WordPress development, but it represents something even more important: our commitment to elevating the standards of MCP server development. We observed that many existing MCP servers, especially those designed for Claude Desktop, were falling short of professional standards - lacking proper testing, type safety, and security measures.

By making our code available for viewing, we're not just sharing a tool - we're setting a new standard for MCP server development. Just as metal music pushes the boundaries of musical excellence, we're pushing the boundaries of what a properly implemented MCP server should be:

- **Technical Excellence**: Like a perfectly executed guitar solo, our code demonstrates pristine TypeScript implementation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every riff (function) is tested, every solo (feature) is verified
- **Security First**: Protected like a fortress of metal, with proper authentication and validation
- **Documentation**: Clear and detailed, like the best metal lyrics

While this remains a private repository, making the code viewable helps other developers understand how to properly implement MCP servers, especially for Claude Desktop integration. It's our way of saying "this is how it's done!" 🎸

### 🔥 Our Philosophy

1. **Technical Excellence**: Setting the standard for MCP development
2. **Creative Innovation**: Breaking boundaries while maintaining stability
3. **Security First**: Enterprise-grade protection by default

If you're using Claude Desktop, you only need to:
1. Configure Claude Desktop integration (see "Claude Desktop Integration" section)
2. Create and configure your `wp-sites.json` file
3. Rock on! 🤘

### Full Installation (for development)
```bash
# Required Software
Node.js ≥ 22.0.0
TypeScript ≥ 5.0.0
PNPM
WordPress site with REST API
```

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deus-h/claudeus-wp-mcp

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Configure Claude Desktop

```

### 3. Configuration
```bash
# Copy example configs
cp .env.example .env
cp wp-sites.json.example wp-sites.json

# Edit .env and wp-sites.json with your settings
```

### Configuring wp-sites.json

The `wp-sites.json` file is used to configure your WordPress sites for integration. Below is an example structure:

```json
{
  "site-alias": {
    "URL": "https://your-wordpress-site.com",
    "USER": "username",
    "PASS": "application-password",
    "authType": "basic"  // or "jwt"
  }
}
```

- **URL**: The URL of your WordPress site.
- **USER**: The username for authentication.
- **PASS**: The application password for secure access.
- **authType**: The authentication type, either "basic" or "jwt".

#### Obtaining the Application Password

1. **Log in to your WordPress Admin Dashboard.**
2. **Navigate to Users > Profile.**
3. **Scroll down to the Application Passwords section.**
4. **Enter a name for the application and click "Add New".**
5. **Copy the generated password and use it in your `wp-sites.json` file.**

Ensure that your `wp-sites.json` file is kept secure and not shared publicly.

### Multi-Site Configuration

The `wp-sites.json` file allows you to manage multiple WordPress sites seamlessly. Here's how you can set it up:

#### Example Structure

```json
{
  "default_test": {
		"URL": "https://test.yourdomain.se",
		"USER": "admin",
		"PASS": "Hn5K pL8x Wm2j Vt9q Bc4y Rs7D",
		"authType": "basic"
	},
  "live": {
    "URL": "https://our-live-site.se",
    "USER": "deus",
    "PASS": "Kj9P mN2x vR4h Zt8L wQ5y Bc3M",
    "authType": "basic"
  },
  "test": {
    "URL": "https://our-test-site.se",
    "USER": "deus",
    "PASS": "Yw7H fT6n Jm5k Vd9x Pg4q Ls2B", 
    "authType": "basic"
  },
  "client1_live": {
    "URL": "https://client1-live-site.se",
    "USER": "deus",
    "PASS": "Xc8D bN4v Ht6m Rk2p Zj9w Qf5L",
    "authType": "basic"
  },
  "client1_test": {
    "URL": "https://client1-test-site.se",
    "USER": "deus",
    "PASS": "Gm7B sW3x Yn5h Kt9q Vf4c Pd2L",
    "authType": "basic"
  }
}
```

#### Logic and Usage

- **Site Aliases**: Each site is identified by a unique alias (e.g., `live`, `test`, `client1_live`). This allows you to easily switch between different environments or client sites.
- **URL**: The base URL for each WordPress site.
- **USER**: The username used for authentication.
- **PASS**: The application password for secure access.
- **authType**: Defines the authentication method, either `basic` or `jwt`.

#### How to Use

1. **Define Multiple Sites**: Add as many site configurations as needed, each with a unique alias.
2. **Switch Between Sites**: Use the alias to select the desired site for operations.
3. **Secure Access**: Ensure that each site has a valid application password and secure authentication method.
4. **Environment Management**: Easily manage different environments (e.g., live, test) for each client.

This setup allows you to efficiently manage multiple WordPress sites from a single configuration file, streamlining your workflow and enhancing productivity.

3. Monitor system usage and performance
4. Maintain backup strategies
5. Use the power responsibly! 🤘

## ⚠️ Issues and Considerations

### Current Limitations and Workarounds

#### 1. Claude Desktop Response Limits
- **Issue**: Claude Desktop's maximum response length can be reached frequently during complex operations
- **Impact**: Operations may be interrupted, requiring user intervention to continue
- **Workaround**: 
  - Configure Claude Desktop to break tasks into smaller batches
  - In Claude Desktop Settings > Advanced:
    - Set "Maximum Response Length" to a lower value
    - Enable "Auto-split Responses"
  - Use the Inspector UI for large-scale operations

#### 2. Experimental Capabilities Control
- **Issue**: The new capability control feature in `wp-sites.json` is experimental
- **Status**: Integrated but under testing
- **Example Configuration**:
```json
{
    "capabilities": {
        "discovery": {
            "claudeus_wp_discover_endpoints": true
        },
        "posts": {
            "claudeus_wp_content__get_posts": true,
            "claudeus_wp_content__create_post": true,
            "claudeus_wp_content__update_post": true,
            "claudeus_wp_content__delete_post": false
        }
        // ... other capabilities
    }
}
```
- **Considerations**:
  - Use with caution in production environments
  - Test thoroughly in staging first
  - Consider contributing improvements (see Contributing section)
  - Default to basic configuration if unsure

#### 3. Rate Limiting Considerations
- **Issue**: WordPress REST API has rate limits
- **Impact**: Bulk operations might be throttled
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Use batch processing features
  - Implement appropriate delays between requests
  - Monitor API response headers for rate limit info

#### 4. Memory Management
- **Issue**: Large operations can consume significant memory
- **Impact**: Potential performance degradation
- **Best Practices**:
  - Monitor system resources during large operations
  - Use pagination for large datasets
  - Implement cleanup routines

### Future Improvements

## 🧙‍♂️ Words of Wisdom

> `npm` is not a package manager, it's a repository of packages. If you want a dependable package manager, always use `pnpm`  
> — Amadeus Samiel H.

### The Package Manager's Anthem
#### *by Amadeus & Claude*
---
*In code's vast land,  
npm stands, a host,  
But pnpm's hand,  
Manages most.*

*With iron might,  
Dependencies align,  
pnpm's light,  
In code, it shines.*

*A true manager's call,  
In the coder's hall,  
pnpm reigns,  
Above them all.*
