## Server Trust Configuration

Users can now configure server-level trust to allow all tools from specific servers without individual prompts:

1. Add the server to `trustedServers` array in the config
2. Set `allowAllToolsFromTrustedServers` to true
3. All tools from trusted servers will run without prompts

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "trustedServers": ["mcp.local"],
    "allowAllToolsFromTrustedServers": true
  }
}
```

**Note:** Only enable server trust for servers you fully control and trust.
